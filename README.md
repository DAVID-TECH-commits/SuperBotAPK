SuperBot — My Personal AI Assistant

Hi! 👋 My name is David, I’m 13 years old, and I built this app completely from scratch in my room.  
SuperBot is a Python-based AI assistant that can answer questions, hold conversations, and help with different tasks — all running locally on your computer.

## 📜 My Story
I’m just 13 years old, and I’ve always been curious about how AI works.  
With no formal classes, I spent weeks learning Python, reading documentation, and testing ideas.  
From my small room, I turned my idea into a working app — all by myself.  
I hope this inspires other kids (and adults) to start building too.
